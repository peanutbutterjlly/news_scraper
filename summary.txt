And that means that if we’re looking for one big “silver bullet” or “grand unified theory” of modern
teenage unhappiness, phones are probably the place to start looking. The burden of proofNow, just
because phones are a good prior does not mean that we should conclude that phones are the culprit.
(2022) with a similar experiment and similar findings for other social media platforms:We randomly
allocated 154 participants..to either stop using [social media] (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and
TikTok) for 1 week or continue to use [social media] as usual. Participants were randomly assigned
to keep their phones on the table or to put their phones away during the meal. Another adaptation is
probably to take social media less seriously.

This time it will be about setting up Home Audio Studio on a FreeBSD 13.1 system. The idea is to use
software like:Jack – audio/jackQtractor – audio/qtractorArdour – audio/ardourMuSE Sequencer –
audio/muse-sequencerThe first step is to setup Jack on FreeBSD – make sure to setup the realtime
mode – this is very important. # echo 'kld_list="${kld_list} mac_priority"' >> /etc/rc.conf #
kldload mac_priorityThen add yourself to realtime group. # pw groupmod realtime -m yourself # grep
realtime /etc/group realtime:*:47:yourselfYou will need to install audio/jack package. # grep jack
/etc/rc.conf jackd_enable="YES" jackd_user="username" jackd_rtprio="YES" jackd_args="-r -d oss
-r44000 -p1024 -n2 -w16 -i4 -o8 -C /dev/dsp0 -P /dev/dsp0"The Qtractor will also require audio/alsa-
seq-server to work.

With more lunar missions than ever on the horizon, the European Space Agency wants to give the moon
its own time zone. That helps to split the time difference between NASA and the Canadian Space
Agency, and the other partnering space programs in Russia, Japan and Europe. The international team
looking into lunar time is debating whether a single organization should set and maintain time on
the moon, according to the European Space Agency.

The Didymos asteroid system is in the centre and the stars appear as streaks.Credit: University of
Canterbury Ōtehīwai Mt John Observatory/UCNZLast September, NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test
(DART) spacecraft smashed into an asteroid, deliberately altering the rock’s trajectory through
space in a first test of planetary defence. DART, which was the size of a golf cart, collided with a
Great Pyramid-sized asteroid called Dimorphos. Microseconds later, the main body of the spacecraft
collided with the rocky surface next to the boulder — and the US$330-million DART shattered to bits.
Dimorphos is 151 metres wide and orbits the larger asteroid Didymos. Images taken as DART approached
Dimorphos on 26 September show the asteroid looking like an egg covered in boulders.

Northern Aboriginal Australians can trace as much as 11% of their genomes to migrants who reached
the island around 4,000 years ago from India, a new study suggests. Irina Pugach, a postdoctoral
researcher from Stoneking’s lab, discovered signs of the Indian migration by comparing genetic
variation across the entire genomes of 344 individuals. She confirmed an ancient association between
the genomes of Australians, New Guineans, and the Mamanwa — a Negrito group from the Philippines.
But Pugach also found evidence of more recent gene flow from India and northern Australia, which
took place around 141 generations ago. “Gene flow is likely to have occurred prior to European
colonization, but not sufficient to disperse through pre-existing peoples.”

One of my ideas for using the backgrounds in Unity game engine, was to remove the lighting from the
image and then add it back in using custom shaders. In order to get my own lighting I needed to
create a normal map for the 2D scene. The resulting normal map is far from perfect but sufficient
enough for my testing. The lighting wraps around surfaces in an almost convincing way in some places
and makes a crude illusion of scene lighting. I tried a few different techniques using the depth and
normal maps in a custom Unity URP shader I created in Amplify Shader Editor.

Credit: Institute of Botany, Czech Academy of SciencesResearchers from the Institute of Botany,
Czech Academy of Sciences, have described the symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae that
science has largely overlooked until now. The coexistence of algae and corticioid basidiomycetes,
which are common in temperate forests, has been given a new name: "alcobiosis." We discovered that
this is a close symbiosis of fungi and algae, not a lichen, though, because the fungus does not
depend on its alga for nourishment." The new term introduced by the researchers for this type of
coexistence, "alcobiosis," is formed by letters from the three key words: algae, corticioid fungi
and symbiosis. They discovered that the symbiosis is very common and occurs in a great many
corticioid fungi across the class of agaricomycetes.

When writing an OS, you need to take care of things like paging, kernel/usermode privilege
separation, interrupts, etc., and I implemented these based on the RISC-V Privilege spec document.
Writing a CISC core such as x86 is really tough, so if you're going to write an OS for fun and run
it on an FPGA, I think RISC-V is a natural choice. Anyway, although I enumerated some reasons above,
the reason why I adopted Rust in this project was that I just felt like writing it in Rust.
According to the RISC-V spec, this subset of instructions makes up 50-60% of most programs and use
of compressed instructions can reduce code size by 25-30%. I did this with help from Writing an OS
in Rust, the Rust official docs, The Embedded Rust Book and RustでRISC-V OS自作！はじめの一歩.

An innovative nuclear fusion technology that uses no radioactive materials and is calculated capable
of “powering the planet for more than 100,000 years”, has been successfully piloted by a US-Japanese
team of researchers. California-based TAE Technologies, working with Japan’s National Institute for
Fusion Science (NIFS), have completed first tests of a hydrogen-boron fuel cycle in magnetically-
confined plasma, which could generate cleaner, lower cost energy that that produced by the more
common deuterium-tritium (D-T) fusion process. “This experiment offers us a wealth of data to work
with and shows that hydrogen-boron has a place in utility-scale fusion power. The TAE
Technologies/Japanese National Institute for Fusion Science team Photo: TAE“Inventing fusion
reactors that produce net energy is one thing, delivering it as a reliable, grid-ready source of
electricity is another. By choosing to pursue hydrogen-boron as a fuel cycle, TAE has anticipated
the true demands of commercial, daily use of fusion energy.

“We know that early-life stress impacts the brain, but until now, we didn’t know how,” Baram said.
We discovered a new pathway within the reward circuit that expresses a molecule called
corticotropin-releasing hormone that controls our responses to stress. They found that this new
pathway, when stimulated, suppresses several types of reward behaviors in male mice. Inhibiting the
pathway restored normal reward behaviors in males, yet it had no effect in females. “We believe that
our findings provide breakthrough insights into the impact of early-life adversity on brain
development and specifically on control of reward behaviors that underlie many emotional disorders.

When Barbara Sherwood Lollar sent water samples to a colleague at the University of Oxford for
testing, she knew this was no ordinary water. “It literally is following your nose right up to the
rock, to find the crack or the fractures where the water is discharging,” says Sherwood Lollar. “As
the water sits there, it accumulates them, like passengers getting on a train,” says Sherwood
Lollar. Tiny chemolithotrophic microbes—an example, as Sherwood Lollar puts it, of life “hanging on
by its toenails”—were present in the water and feasting on hydrogen and sulfate. If water can breed
life far beneath Timmins, there’s a chance the same is true on the Red Planet.
