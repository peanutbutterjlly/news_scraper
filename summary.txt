Phil, dejected once again, took the plane to Vancouver alone, wearing an old raincoat and carrying
only a battered suitcase and a bible. By the end of the second day, Phil had made up his mind to
stay in Vancouver. Although he continued to visit the Walsh’s and accompany them to dinner parties,
the first blush of Vancouver was starting to fade. If he could fake being a human so well, how did
he know that everyone else wasn’t doing the same? A few days after the Walsh’s had thrown Phil out
of their home, Susan received a phone call from Phil.

This mathematical analysis unifies conflicting viewpoints on the origin of lane formation, and it
reveals a new class of structures that in daily life may go unnoticed. Professor Rogers said, "At a
glance, a crowd of pedestrians attempting to pass through two gates might seem disorderly but when
you look more closely, you see the hidden structure. Lane formationThe single-file processions
formed at busy zebra crossings are only one example of lane formation, and this study is likely to
have implications for a range of scientific disciplines, particularly in the fields of physics and
biology. Lead author Dr. Karol Bacik said, "Lane formation doesn't require conscious thought—the
participants of the experiment were not aware that they had arranged themselves into well-defined
mathematical curves." "What we've developed is a neat mathematical theory that forecasts the
propensity for lane formation in any given system," said Professor Rogers.

Finding Java Thread Leaks With JDK Flight Recorder and a Bit Of SQLThe other day at work, we had a
situation where we suspected a thread leak in one particular service, i.e. Luckily, Java’s built-in
event recorder and performance analysis tool, JDK Flight Recorder, exposes all the data you need to
identify thread leaks and their cause. outputformat verticalRun the following SQL query for finding
thread start events without corresponding thread join events:1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 SELECT ts . In that
case the stack traces of the thread start events may not tell you enough about the root cause of the
problem, i.e. Equipped with JDK Flight Recorder, JDK Mission Control, and JFR Analytics, identifying
and fixing thread leaks in your Java application is becoming a relatively simple task.

Hex worked all these clubs, and she said the star performer was a guy named ASCII, who really didn’t
get along at all with Octal. Then I closed the Octal file, even though it still seemed like ASCII
had some hand in his death. That ASCII guy was a shifty character. It was time to call up ASCII
again because I had a lot of new questions for him. And ASCII didn’t want the likes of a guy like
that at his table.

Ever since the Tunguska event, scientists and lay enthusiasts alike have wondered what caused it.
The study of the Tunguska event is important because past collisions with extraterrestrial bodies
have had major effects on the evolution of the earth. The researchers have also extrapolated their
findings to larger but rarer incidents such as the Tunguska event. Understanding the Tunguska event
could help us prepare for such an eventuality and maybe even take steps to avoid its occurrence
altogether. Astrophysicists have since created numerical simulations of the Tunguska event to try to
decide among the competing hypotheses.

At least two companies in British Columbia, Canada, say they’ve received exemptions from the federal
government allowing them to produce and distribute cocaine, heroin, MDMA, or magic mushrooms. “It is
not part of our provincial plan," he said, noting that he would be following up with Health Canada
about the announcements. Canada already has safe supply programs, through which people with opioid
addictions can access pharmaceutical heroin and fentanyl. There are no safe supply programs for
cocaine, but activist group the Drug User Liberation Front has repeatedly handed out free cocaine,
heroin and meth, as part of safe supply protests in Vancouver. The U.S. does not have any safe
supply programs.

procal: A simple Qt-based programming calculatorAny python code that can be eval() 'd and cast to
float without raising an exception is accepted. The binary representation of the result is shown in
the table, and the binary, decimal, and hexadecimal representation is displayed at the bottom. Bits
in the binary table can be toggled by clicking them (click and drag to toggle a range of bits).
Right-clicking a bit turns it into a sign bit, which makes the decimal representation negative. I
wrote this after some frustration with the default Gnome calculator's programming mode:

Image by Annie RuygtThis dev blog introduces LiveView's new Streams feature. In practice it looked
like this:def render ( assigns ) do ~H"" " <div id=" users " phx-update=" append "> <div :for={user
<- @users} id={" user - #{user.id}"}> <%= user . The following two lines are equivalent:stream (
socket , :users , users ) stream ( socket , :users , users , dom_id: & "users- #{ &1 . id } " )Next,
in the template in render/1 , we mark the container as phx-update="stream" , then we use a regular
for comprehension, but with two changes. Streams are placed under a @streams assign, and when you
enumerate a stream you get the computed DOM id along with each item. For deletes, stream_delete
works as you'd expect:stream_delete ( socket , :users , user )Here's a fully realized example of
what streams unlock for LiveView developers.

Getting started with C++ MathGL on Windows and LinuxIn this article, I will show you how to install
and get started with the C++ interface of MathGL on Linux and Windows. Install MathGL on Windows:On
Windows, the recommended approach to install MathGL is to use the official MathGL binaries. Open the
include folder of MathGL and copy the include folder mgl2. Install MathGL on Linux:For Linux, I will
exemplify the installation part on a Debian based system. C++ MathGL usage example:Here is a small
C++ MathGL program that will draw a wave curve and save the graphic in an image file named

tmux has an interesting quirk in the way it handles environment variables that if you’re not careful
can cause some seemingly strange behavior. From the tmux man page:When the server is started, tmux
copies the environment into the global environment; in addition, each session has a session
environment. Each session also has an environment that is merged with the original global
environment but it only has a set list of environment variables that are updated. You can see this
with the following command in a tmux session:> tmux show-environment -DISPLAY -KRB5CCNAME
-SSH_AGENT_PID -SSH_ASKPASS SSH_AUTH_SOCK -SSH_CONNECTION -WINDOWIDkj -XAUTHORITYThis can cause some
interesting consequences when you have multiple named tmux sessions running. > export FOO = foo >
tmux new-session -t first > echo $FOO foo > export FOO = bar > tmux -L other new-session -t second >
echo $FOO bar

It is that present-day Europe and the West look like the Renaissance city-states of Italy. The
Italian city-states were rich, powerful, economically dynamic, politically advanced, and culturally
dominant. Italian city-states: the potted historyNorth Italy is still one of the richest areas of
Europe. It was true of the Italian city-states. So, as Barbara Tuchman said of the fourteenth
century, Renaissance Italy holds up a distant mirror to our own time.

In 2018, there were very few trials of somatic genome-editing therapies; now there are well over
100, says Lovell-Badge. The treatment could become the first genome-editing therapy to be approved,
but researchers are watching anxiously to see how much it will cost. It is hoped that these
techniques, called base editing and prime editing, can yield safer genome-editing therapies. The
relative dearth of information on such sequences from individuals of non-European descent could
leave regions of the world without access to genome editing therapies that will work for them. It’s
possible that genome-editing therapies, which also use snippets of RNA, will involve similar
delivery systems, says Musunuru, so could use the same fundamental technology.

Oxidising means to rewrite some code, in this case a project written in Python, into Rust code.
Usually a project is oxidised into Rust because of many reasons, the main usually being memory
safety. Of course, rewriting a project in Rust is pointless without good reasons: if a solution to a
problem already exists, there should be no need to rewrite it :-). SD card or USB flash drive)Bmap

The US Secret Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agencies have failed to follow
the law and official policy regarding the use of cell-site simulators, according to a government
audit. Cell-site simulators (CSS), also known as Stingrays or IMSI Catchers, are devices that serve
as decoy cell towers. But annoyingly it redacts statistical data about the number of investigations
utilizing CSS devices in 2020 and 2021. And the following year, the US Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in US
v. Carpenter that the warrantless search and seizure of cell-site data violated the Fourth
Amendment. But the report, he said, indicates that there's still a lot of confusion about
differences between historical cell-site data, real-time cell-site data, and emergency access, and
so on.

How the C64 Keyboard WorksI'm almost ashamed to admit it, but just 1 year ago when I started working
on C64 OS, I didn't have the first clue how the C64 Keyboard worked. The keyboard port is a block of
pins in the middle of the logic board, which the keyboard is connected to. I took apart a C64
keyboard, shown below, so we can see what its insides look like. UPDATE: March 3, 2023Below you can
see a visualization of the columns listed in the table above, superimposed over the actual C64
keyboard. This also lets us map the Keyboard PCB letter/number scheme to the C64 logicboard's 20-pin
keyboard connector.
